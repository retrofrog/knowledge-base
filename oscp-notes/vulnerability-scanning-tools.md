# Vulnerability Scanning Tools

In this document, we will be covering how to configure vulnerability scans using both commercial and open-source products. The products covered are listed below: **Commercial Vulnerability scanners**

* Nessus: Full Vulnerability Scanner
* Nexpose: Full Vulnerability Scanner
* Acunetix: Full Vulnerability Scanner
* Qualys: Full Vulnerability Scanner **Open Source Vulnerability scanners**
* OWASP ZAP: Web Application Scanner
* OpenVas: Web Application Scanner
* Nikto: Web Application Scanner
* Wapiti: Web Application Scanner
* SQLmap: Database Vulnerability Scanner

#### Nessus

**Configuring Scanning Templates**

First step of configuring the scan is choosing a template. Below are ready templates provided by Nessus. !\[\[nessus-1.png]] When you choose a custom template built and developed by your team, consider saving common configuration settings in templates to allow efficient reuse of their work, saving time and reducing errors when configuring future scans.

**Plugins**

We can improve the efficiency of the scans by configuring the specific plug-ins that will run during each scan. Each plug-in performs a check for a specific vulnerability, and these plug-ins are often grouped into families based on the operating system, application, or device that they involve. Disabling unnecessary plug-ins improves the speed of the scan by bypassing unnecessary checks and also may reduce the number of false positive results detected by the scanner. Below shows examples of plugins that are disabled for the upcoming scan !\[\[nessus-2.png]]

**Scanning a web application**

We can choose to run Nessus as a web application scanner to scan a website for vulnerabilities as shown below by selecing `scan for known web vulnerabilities` !\[\[nessus-4.png]]

**Working with reports**

When the scan is finished, Nessus gives out a report detailing the discovered vulnerabilities. In the below figure, we see the name of the vulnerability, which offers a descriptive title, and the overall severity of the vulnerability, expressed as a general category, such as low, medium, high, or critical. In this example report, the scanner is reporting that a server is running an outdated and insecure version of the SSL protocol. It is assigned to the high severity category. The report also provides a detailed description of the flaws in the SSL protocol and explains that SSL is no longer considered acceptable for use. In the solution section, the scanner outlines how to patch the vulnerability or fix the problem. The port/hosts section provides details on the server(s) that contain the vulnerability as well as the specific services on that server that have the vulnerability. In this case, the serverâ€™s IP address is obscured for privacy reasons, but we can see that the server is running insecure versions of SSL on both ports 443 and 4433. !\[\[nessus-5.png]]

**Configuring Updates**

Vulnerability scanners can only be effective against these vulnerabilities if they receive frequent updates to their plug-ins therefore you should configure your scanner to retrieve new plug-ins on a regular basis, preferably daily. Figure below shows where to find this options. !\[\[nessus-3.png]]

#### Qualys

**Launching a Scan**

In the figure below, we start a new scan and we set the scan name, scanner appliance (external vs internal), choose the assets covered in the scan and we can also include and exclude IP ranges from the scope of the scan !\[\[qualys-2.png]]

**Credentialed Scans**

Figure below shows adjusting the options and targets for a credentialed scan !\[\[qualys-1.png]]

**Configuring Scan Performance**

You can limit the resource consumption on the target server that will be scanned by adjusting the query throttling to limit the rate at which the scanner sends requests to a single web application. !\[\[qualys-4.png]]

**Working with reports**

Qualys produces similar reports in format to Nessus. You can check below an example !\[\[qualys-5.png]]

#### Acunetix

**Reporting vulnerabilities**

The figure below shows the discovered vulnerabilities after the scan is finished !\[\[Acunetix-1.png]]
