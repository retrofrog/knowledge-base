# Enumeration

In penetration testing, post-enumeration refers to the phase that occurs after an attacker has gathered information about a target system or network. Enumeration is the process of actively gathering information about the target, such as user accounts, network shares, services running on the system, and other valuable details that could aid in the penetration testing process.
